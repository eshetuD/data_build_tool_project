# Leveraging the pNEUMA Dataset: Building a Data Pipeline with dbt and PostgreSQL

## Introduction

The modern data landscape is marked by an abundance of datasets that serve as valuable resources for gaining insights and making informed decisions. Among these, the pNEUMA dataset stands out as a rich source of information, offering unique opportunities for analysis and interpretation. This essay explores the significance of the pNEUMA dataset and outlines the development of a data pipeline using dbt (data build tool) and PostgreSQL.

## Understanding the pNEUMA Dataset

Understanding the structure and organization of the pNEUMA dataset is crucial for effectively analyzing and extracting insights from the wealth of information it contains. With a focus on vehicle track data and trajectory information, each CSV file follows a specific format, and its columns are organized to capture various aspects of the vehicles' movements. Let's break down the organization based on the provided information:

### File Structure:

Each CSV file represents the data for multiple vehicles, with each row corresponding to a single vehicle's data.
The first row of each CSV file contains the column names, providing a clear reference for the information stored in each column.
Trajectory Information (First 4 Columns):

The first four columns in each row provide essential information about the trajectory of the vehicle.
trackID: A unique identifier for the vehicle's trajectory.
vehicle type: Specifies the type of vehicle.
distance traveled: Indicates the distance traveled by the vehicle in meters.
average speed: Represents the average speed of the vehicle in km/h.

### Temporal Information (Repeating Blocks of 6 Columns):

The remaining columns are organized based on a time frequency, with blocks of six columns repeating.

Columns 5-10: Contain information related to the vehicle's position and speed at a specific time.

latitude at time column_10: Latitude coordinates of the vehicle at a specific time.
longitude at time column_10: Longitude coordinates of the vehicle at the same time.
speed at time column_10: Speed of the vehicle at the same time.
longitudinal acceleration at time column_10: Longitudinal acceleration in m/sec².
lateral acceleration at time column_10: Lateral acceleration in m/sec².
time: Time in seconds.
This pattern repeats for subsequent time intervals, with each block of six columns capturing information about the vehicle's position, speed, and acceleration at different points in time.

### Units of Measurement:

Speed is measured in kilometers per hour (km/h).
Longitudinal and lateral accelerations are measured in meters per second squared (m/sec²).
Time is measured in seconds.

So as you can see from the above data lineage first we got data which imported to data warehouse by airflow python operator by other project we did in the interim report.

Initially, this data is sourced and imported into the data warehouse leveraging the Airflow Python operator. This operator, a key component established in a preceding project detailed in our interim report, plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the ingestion process.

Once the raw data resides within the data warehouse, the subsequent phase involves a series of transformative steps. These transformations are meticulously designed to render the dataset more conducive to the distinct needs of various teams within the organization, including the Machine Learning Team, Analysis Team, and Business Intelligence Team.

The transformations applied during this phase are tailored to enhance the dataset's usability and relevance for each team's specific objectives. For the Machine Learning Team, this may involve feature engineering or preprocessing steps that optimize the data for machine learning models. The Analysis Team might benefit from transformations that facilitate exploratory data analysis and pattern recognition. Simultaneously, the Business Intelligence Team could find value in transformations that structure the data for insightful reporting and visualization.

In essence, this data lineage underscores a comprehensive and strategic approach to handling the pNEUMA dataset. It ensures that the data, from its initial import to the data warehouse through the Airflow Python operator, undergoes tailored transformations that empower diverse teams within the organization to derive meaningful insights and make informed decisions based on the specific requirements of their respective domains.
